This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Exercise from A Web fullStack development course (Front + Next API with Prisma and Postgres DB)

**2026/02/02 - 2026/02/03**
- Migration AWS => HostArmada (scp)
- Dump SQL : MariaDB => PostgreSQL with pgloader
- ended up here after problematic Supabase (ipv4) and Vercel deployment issues (Prisma V7)
- the project is quite empty now : I need to populate.

**Next : Docker in vps integration !**
